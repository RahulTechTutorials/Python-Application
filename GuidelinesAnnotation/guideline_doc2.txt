Submit operating and capital budgets to the Finance Committee in time for reasonable approval by the Board prior to each fiscal year. Use responsible assumptions and projections as background, with the general goal of an unrestricted surplus. Insure against theft and casualty losses to the organization and against liability losses to Board members, staff, or the organization itself to levels indicated in consultation with suitable professional resources. Plan and carry out suitable protection and maintenance of property, building, and equipment. Avoid actions that would expose the organization, its board, or its staff to claims of liability. Protect intellectual property, information, and files from unauthorized access, tampering, loss, or significant damage. Receive, process, and disburse funds under controls that are sufficient to maintain basic segregation of duties to protect bank accounts,income receipts, and payments.
